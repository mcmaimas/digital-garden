Data colonialism is widespread because the process is profitable. The cost of collecting, storing and processing user data is less than the cost made from targetted ads, but what would happen if that weren't the case anymore?

Idk how much info is stored typically per person, but what if the amount of data per user were to go up in enough orders of magnitude to make the process of collecting/storing/processing user data no longer viable. There has to be some upper bound to data collection, so what happens if we hit it?

For example, what if there was browser extension (or something similar) that generated the equivalent of white noise for ads and it constantly streamed all sorts of irrelevant browser/search information to the point where targetted ads were no longer profitable. This could be because targetted ads were no longer effective or because the amount of data stored per user was extremely high.

It means we would have to shift away from an ad fueled internet, but is that even a good thing? Wouldn't it just put the cost of using the internet on the user? If that's the case does the internet become a luxury only for people who can afford it or would it then need to be financed/subsidized by ones local government? If it's managed/financed by some form of government wouldn't they impose their own form of control/surveillance on the users and would that be any better than the ad based internet we have now? Is there a different solution that I'm not thinking about?


The only solution I can think of is if everyone was capable of hosting their own website at its own custom domain. That way they own everything related to their site and they control access however they want. Facebook and Instagram are basically just template engines anyway, but people sign up to use them because building their own is out of the question for now.
