# Ideas

-It would be really cool to have roles for this. 1 is a view only role and 1 is edit mode where you can add notes/music. That way I could share the link to the site and have a portfolio but also have a useful site
- In the margin between each section I could have plants since I like to think of this as a digital garden. When you mouse over them the cursor could change to a watering can and water comes out when you click

# Design

## Top Section:

Top Left Section: Reading Material
- I want to insert links and then have those saved for laters
- I want to check off ones I have read
- I want to be able to star articles that I like

Top Right Section: Showoff section
- I want to have a cool 3D blob timer. Intensity decreases as time passes until it hits 0
- I want my spotify playlist creator here

## Bottom Section:

Bottom Left Section: Note navigator + creation
- I want to be able to create notes here
- I want to browse previosulyu created notes

Bottom Right Section
- I want to view notes in markdown
- I want to edit notes
- I want to delete notes


## Extras
- I will need to setup a dumb glitch server for...
1. Spotify Playlist Creation
2. Saving/deleting text files as notes. I could set up a db too or I could use a bunch of jsons
